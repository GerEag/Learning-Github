This is Gerald E.'s personal repository which contains miscellaneous code from undergradute and graduate mechanical engineering classes, projects, and research. Feel free to use.

Code used to generate results for publications can be found in the [CRAWLAB's](https://github.com/CRAWlab) private repositories. Feel free to contact me at gerald.eaglin1@louisiana.edu for access to that code.
