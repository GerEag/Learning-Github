This is Gerald E.'s personal repository which contains miscellaneous code from undergradute and graduate mechanical engineering classes, projects, and research. Feel free to use.

Code used to generate results for publications can be found in the [CRAWLAB's](https://github.com/CRAWlab) private repositories. You may inquire about code used for publications by emailing me at geaglin@lsu.edu.
