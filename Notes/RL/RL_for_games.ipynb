    "DQN achieved performance comparible to  professional human game tester level across 49 Atari 2600 games (some actually performed very poorly compared to human, but 29 performed 75% of human level or better) [2]. Many performed much better than humans. All examples used the same convolutional convolutional neural network and hyperparameters. The agents were able to learn from pixel data/video.\n",
