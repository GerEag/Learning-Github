    "## Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "The earliest and simplest way to guarantee stability when gain scheduling is to ensure that the scheduling variable varies slowly. For the case of switched systems, it is important that the system switch infrequently enough to ensure the transient behavior adequately dies out. As far as I can tell, the theoretical guarantee is only for unvarying scheduling variable or no switching. Practical limits depend on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global stability can also be guaranteed by finding piecewise Lyapunov functions. In general, stability for a subregion of state-space (potentially global) is guaranteed provided a Lyapunov function, $V(x)$, can be found such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$V(x)\\geq 0, \\ \\forall x\\neq 0 \\quad$ and $\\quad V(0)=0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{V}(x)\\leq 0, \\ \\forall x\\neq0 \\quad$ and $\\quad \\dot{V}(0)=0$\n",
    "\n",
    "I.e. the Lyapunov function must be at least positive semi-definite and the derivative of the Lyapunov function must be at least negative semi-definite. A globally continuous Lyapunov function is often used to determine system stability. For gain scheduling, a piecewise model can be generated for the system and controller such that a piecewise Lyapunov function can be generated. If the Lyapunov conditions are satisfied for the sub-system/subregion of state space, the system is stable about the desired equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done using several methods. Global stability is guaranteed as (opposed to local stability) if using the same coordinate system or state-space for each Lyapunov function. If Lyapunov conditions are satisfied for each subsystem, switched system or subregion of the state-space, global stability is achieved."
